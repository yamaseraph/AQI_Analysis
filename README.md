# Air Pollutant Trends utilizing ARIMA model 
We are analyzing the air pollutant trends (CO, NOX, NH3, PM10, etc.) for years 2002-2022.
Utilizing this data, we will plot the trends and predictions.
Then we will calculate the residual (difference between predicted and actual expected value) for 2019-2022.
With the same model, we will also graph and predict the pollutants(CO, NOX, NH3, PM10, etc.) level for year 2023.

You can find the original dataset we obtained from EPA's website at: https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/air-pollutant-emissions-trends-data.
The data that we used for our notebook, "state_trends.xlsx" can be found in this github under the same name
